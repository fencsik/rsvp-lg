# T2 Guessing Accuracy

Simulate T2 trial guessing strategy. T2 is present 2/3 of the time and absent 1/3 of the time.

What will accuracy be if people guess blindly, 50% yes and 50% no?

Simulate trials

```{r, simulate5050}
n = 100000
trials = sample(c(1, 1, 0), n, replace=TRUE)
responses = sample(c(1, 0), n, replace=TRUE)
sum(trials == responses) / n
```

Seems to be about 50%. If the probability of guessing yes increases from 50%, the probably correct will approach 66.667%, and if it decreases below 50% it will approach 33.333%.
